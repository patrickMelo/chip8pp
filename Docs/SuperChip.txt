SUPER-CHIP v1.0
===============

... a modified version of the CHIP-8 game interpreter originally
made by Andreas Gustafsson.

S-CHIP offers:

- full screen resolution in new extended screen mode
- downward compability (you can run your old CHIP games)
- faster execution in extended mode
- a larger 16x16 sprite available
- new, larger fonts for scores
- you can pass information to and from a S-CHIP program
- programmable exit from the S-CHIP interpreter possible
- no need to turn off the clock
- it will always start

What can this mean to the next generation of CHIP games?

- Higher resolution and faster action.

- One can make a strategy game in RPL with combat parts programmed
in S-CHIP. When one of the players has won the combat, the S-CHIP
program can exit and pass the results on to the main RPL program.

- High score screens etc can be done in RPL and the action parts
in S-CHIP.

Hex      Chipper            Description
---      -------            -----------

00FF     DB #00, #FF        Turn extended screen mode ON, enabling
                            higher speed and full screen (64x128)
                            resolution. Default is OFF.

00FE     DB #00, #FE        Turn extended screen mode OFF.

00FD     DB #00, #FD        Exit from S-CHIP environment
         
DXY0     DRW VX, VY, 0      Draw 16x16 pixels sprite from [I] at
                            VX, VY. Sprite is stored in 32 bytes, 2
                            bytes per row with leftmost byte last.

FX30     DB #FX, #30        Points I to 10-byte sprite for the
                            digit in VX (0..9).
 
FX75     DB #FX, #75        Store V0..VX in RPL user flags (X<=7)

FX85     DB #FX, #85        Read V0..VX from RPL user flags (X<=7)

The "Chipper" column is the necessary commands for the Chipper
assembler written by Christian Egeberg. I highly recommend this
program!
